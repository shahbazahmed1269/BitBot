# BitBot
Simple API to fetch exchange rate of 1 bitcoin in INR,  created with Node.js and Express.
It has 2 endpoints:
1) http://bitbot-service-bitbot.44fs.preview.openshiftapps.com/sell - gives the selling rate of 1 bitcoin in Rupees
2) http://bitbot-service-bitbot.44fs.preview.openshiftapps.com/buy - gives the buying rate of 1 bitcoin in Rupees

This is my first step in learning Node.js. The basic idea behind this is to deploy it to Openshift (PaaS) in a docker image. This is just to learn about creating docker image and its deployment to the cloud.
